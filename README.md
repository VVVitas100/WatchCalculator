# WatchCalculator
The Calculator for Watches app is designed for use on wearable devices running on "full-fledged" versions of Android, not Wear.
It is inconvenient to use a full-fledged calculator application with a large interface on a small screen.
Therefore, I developed a simple calculator with a compact interface for my smartwatch.
Since I'm mastering mobile development, I decided to try the Git tool.
That's why I'm here :)
